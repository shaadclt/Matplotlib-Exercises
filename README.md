# Matplotlib Plotting Practice

This project provides a collection of Jupyter Notebook exercises for practicing Matplotlib plots, including bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots. Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python that allows for creating a wide range of plots and visualizations. Through this project, we aim to enhance our data visualization skills using Matplotlib and gain hands-on experience with different plot types and customization options.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Matplotlib-Exercises.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Matplotlib-Exercises
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) in Jupyter.

6. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to practice and explore different Matplotlib plots.

## Project Overview

The project covers various Matplotlib plots, including but not limited to:

1. Bar Plots: Creating bar plots to compare categorical variables or visualize frequency distributions.
2. Histograms: Plotting the distribution of numerical data using bins or bins with density estimation.
3. Pie Charts: Creating pie charts to represent the proportion of different categories in a dataset.
4. Scatter Plots: Visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables using points on a Cartesian plane.

Each notebook includes code snippets, and practice exercises to reinforce the understanding of Matplotlib plots.

## Results and Insights

The emphasis of this project is on practicing and implementing Matplotlib plots rather than providing specific results or insights. Each notebook contains exercises and examples to apply the plots learned and gain a deeper understanding of data visualization using Matplotlib. Feel free to experiment with different datasets, modify the exercises, or explore additional plot types beyond the provided exercises.

## Customization

You can customize the project by adding your own datasets, creating additional notebooks for specific plot types, or expanding the exercises with more advanced customization options. This project serves as a starting point for you to practice and enhance your data visualization skills using Matplotlib.
